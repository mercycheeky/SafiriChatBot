- Hello. I loove Google products. They make life easier and better. Heard of Dialogflow before? Dialogflow is a natural language understanding platform that makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface into your mobile app, web application, device, bot, interactive voice response system, and so on. This project involves creating a bank chatbot that can respond to customers' inquiries allowing them to save both them and a bank institution time and money. This proposed chat bot will serve customers in a financial liability company. 
- In this research, secondary data was used. It comprised of Frequently Asked Questions on the banks online platforms.KCB FAQs. It was concluded that the number of staff is less than the number of customers who come in the bank daily, evidence that human service is insufficient. What is the result? Customers end up making long queues that at times become hectic when people are many. Quality of the service is also reduced at times when customer care staff wants to make sure these lines shrink faster. The primary goal of this bank bot is, a customer can interact with mentioning their queries in plain English and the bot can resolve their queries with appropriate response in return.
#Methodology
Consisted of integration of multiple technologies. In order to come up with a web application that emulated the end user's perspective, I started by cloning another website.The application was developed using the Python Flask web 
framework. After coming up with a good interface, it was now possible to integrate the chat bot.
##Conclusion
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the potential of chat bots to improve customer 
engagement and reduce costs in the banking industry.With the small talk feature that comes with dialogflow, the chat bot is able to offer a 
personalized user experience and try to make the user feel that it can also engage in small 
talks like other human beings.
